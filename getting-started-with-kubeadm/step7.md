Kubernetes has a web-based dashboard UI giving visibility into the
Kubernetes cluster.

##Â Task

Deploy the dashboard yaml with the command `kubectl apply -f dashboard.yaml`{{execute HOST1}}

The dashboard is deployed into the _kube-system_ namespace. View the
status of the deployment with `kubectl get pods -n kube-system`{{execute HOST1}}

When the dashboard was deployed, it was assigned a NodePort
of 30000. This makes the dashboard available to outside of the cluster
and viewable at:

https://[[HOST2_SUBDOMAIN]]-30000-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/

For your cluster, the dashboard yaml definition can be downloaded from
https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard/blob/master/src/deploy/kubernetes-dashboard.yaml.
