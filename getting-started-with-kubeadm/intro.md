## Overview
In this scenario you'll learn how to bootstrap a Kubernetes cluster
using Kubeadm.

Kubeadm solves the problem of handling TLS encryption configuration,
deploying the core Kubernetes components and ensuring that additional
nodes can easily join the cluster. The resulting cluster is secured
out-of-the box through the use of RBAC and TLS.
