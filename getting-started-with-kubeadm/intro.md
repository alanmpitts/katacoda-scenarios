In this scenario you'll learn how to bootstrap a Kubernetes cluster using Kubeadm.

Kubeadm solves the problem of handling TLS encryption configuration, deploying the core Kubernetes components and ensuring that additional nodes can easily join the cluster. The resulting cluster is secured out of the box via mechanisms such as RBAC.
